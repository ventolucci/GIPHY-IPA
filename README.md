Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.

Allow users to request additional gif's to be added to the page.

Each request should ADD 10 gif's to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.
List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.

Include a 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types.

Integrate this search with additional api's such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcae in your portfolio

Allow users to add their favorite gif's to a favorites section
